## Description

Have you ever wanted to build a big house in the sky, but you can't because it would take ages to build up from the ground.

Now you can!

The balloonblocks can be placed in the air.
This means it is now easy to place a block up in the sky.

When placing a balloonblock in the air it is always placed three blocks away from your current position.
If you can fly, then you don't have to build to place a node. You can just fly up and place a balloonblock!
