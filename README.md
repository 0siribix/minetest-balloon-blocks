## Description

Have you ever wanted to build a big house in the sky?

But you can't because it would take ages to build up from the ground.

Now you can!

The balloonblocks can be placed on air, this means there is no more trouble getting a block up in the sky.

When placing a balloonblock in the air it is always placed three blocks away.

That means it is an efficient way to build a path in the sky (if you don't have fly).

You can just jump onto one height above your current height or the same height.

But, if you can fly, then you don't have to build up.

You can just fly up and place a balloonblock!
